Traffic Accidents Presentation

##What is FARS?

FARS stands for [Fatality Analysis Reporting System](http://www.nhtsa.gov/FARS).  It is a nationwide census providing National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Congress and the American Public yearly data regarding fatal injuries suffered in motor vehicle traffic crashes.

##Findings
Our searches were related to drug and alcohol use while causing fatal
traffic accidents.  We wondered whether people who were drinking and
driving (and speeding) occurred in different rates between different
income brackets.  We looked at the brackets 0-30K, 30K-60K, and 60K+.  

We found that there was a correlation between people who make more
than 60K and people who were speeding and causing fatal traffic
accidents.  

Since the income in our set is the median income from the zip code
where the person is licensed, we thought therre could be more learned
from examining speeding against other attributes.  We found that
people who drive cars that might be considered "sporty" were speeding
at higher rates than those who drove a less "sporty" car.  

After looking at just income, we decided to look at some other
factors, and we found that there were some makes of cars, such as
Porsche, that show a much higher probability of having drug use, in
addition to speeding, and alcohol use being involved in the accident.  

Continuing the drug theme, we decided to look at which states had
higher rates of drug related accidents.  After filtering out those
that had too few records to be significant (some states only had 1),
we found that Arkansas, Illinois, and Texas had some of the highest
rates of drug related traffic accidents.  Illinois and Texas are two
of the most populous states, but Arkansas is the [32nd most populous
state.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population#States_and_territories)

We also decided to use anomaly detection to try to find out what makes
a typical drunk driver.  We found that the msot anomalous data points
were those in which the driver had no prior license suspensions, dwi,
or speeding citations.   

##Analysis

###Tableau Analysis
####Speeding while Drunk by Income
![](./images/speeding_by_income.png)

**Description of "Speeding Income"**
Average of Was Speeding for each Capped Median (bin).  The marks are labeled by sum of Number of Records and average of Was Speeding. The data is filtered on Median (bin), which keeps 0K, 60K, 120K and 180K.

**Marks**
The mark type is Bar (Automatic).
The marks are labeled by sum of Number of Records and average of Was Speeding.
Stacked marks is on.
